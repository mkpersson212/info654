    <h1>INFO 654 Assignment 2 - Web Basics</h1> 
   
   <p class="greenparagraph">Welcome to my site. This is a very brief history of some randomly chosen internet memes. More brief than I'd like, but I had limited time and even more limited skill with development.<br> I appreciate the challenge of scope limitation, and the frustration when ideas far outpace technical feasibility. I also appreciate that there are no points for design. üôÉ <br> I don't yet know how to use cookies or other memory functionality that would let me keep persistent theming across pages based on user selections (light/dark mode, etc.), but it's something I'd <em>like</em> to learn.</p>
    
   <h2>What is a Meme?</h2>
    <p>The term "meme" was coined by evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins in his 1976 book <em>The Selfish Gene</em>, where he described it as a ‚Äúunit of cultural transmission‚Äù ‚Äî an idea or behavior that spreads from person to person through imitation.
    <br><br>In the digital age, memes evolved into viral images, videos, phrases, or formats shared widely online, often with humorous or satirical intent. Early internet memes were simple and text-based, but they quickly grew into a rich visual language that spans generations and platforms.
    <br><br>In my personal experience, sharing memes is a way of keeping in touch, albeit minimally, with friends that have shared experiences or ways of thinking, and remind them you're thinking of them.
